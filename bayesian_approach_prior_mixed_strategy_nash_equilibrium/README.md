### A Bayesian Approach with Prior Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium for Vehicle Intention Prediction
In this project, a bayesian approach for vehicle intention forecasting has been developed, utilizing a game-theoretic framework 
in the form of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) as a prior estimate to model the reciprocal influence between traffic participants. 
The likelihood is then computed based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The game is modeled as a static nonzero-sum polymatrix game with 
individual preferences, a well known strategic game. Finding the MSNE for these games is in the PPAD PLS complexity class, with polynomial-time 
tractability. The approach shows good results in simulations in the long term horizon (10s), with its computational complexity allowing for online applications. 

The algorithm has been implemented and tested in [ADORe](https://github.com/eclipse-adore/adore). For further information please visit the [page]
