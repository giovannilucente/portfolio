### Decentralized Platoon Management and Cooperative Cruise Control
In this project, realized with colleagues from DLR, a decentralized platoon management is designed and implemented, based on V2V communication between automated 
vehicles by using Manoeuvre Coordination Message (MCM), to manage the platooning state of each vehicle and when the vehicles are in a platoon or joining one, 
a cruise controller is designed and implemented to guarantee the desired headway to a preceding vehicle. For further details please visit the [project page](https://giovannilucente.github.io/portfolio/cooperative_cruise_control/index.html).
