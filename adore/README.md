### ADORe: Automated Driving Open Research
Eclipse ADORe is a modular software library and toolkit for decision making, planning, control and simulation of automated vehicles. 
It is developed by the [German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute for Transportation Systems](https://www.dlr.de/en/ts/). ADORe provides: 
- Algorithms and data models applied in real automated driving system for motion planning and control.
- Mechanisms for safe interaction with other CAVs, infrastructure, traffic management, interactions with human-driven vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians
- ADORe is ROS 2 based
- ADORe is fully containerized using Docker
- ADORe is currently deployed on DLR TS institute research vehicles FASCar and VIEWCar II

An ADORe control system works in concert with a perception stack to control an autonomous vehicle platform. 
Using V2X radio messages, a list of detected objects and ego vehicle position and velocity, the ADORe control system provides 
control inputs to a vehicle platform in order to steer it along a given high-definition roadmap to the desired goal location.

For more information and to explore the full potential of ADORe, please visit the [ADORe GitHub repository](https://github.com/DLR-TS/adore?tab=readme-ov-file).
