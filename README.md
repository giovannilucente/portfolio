# Portfolio
This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on over the years. For some of them I can share the codebase.
For more information about me and the projects I worked on, please visit my [website](https://giovannilucente.github.io/portfolio/).

## 1. DeepGame-TP: Dynamic Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planner
The topic of this project is a trajectory planner based on a game-theoretical framework. Traffic is modeled as a non-cooperative dynamic game, in which agents choose their optimal strategies while considering that other agents are also optimizing their own strategies. The trajectory planner solves the dynamic game by computing the **Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)**, a state where no agent can improve its outcome unilaterally, given the strategic choices and constraints of all other agents. For further information please check the [website of the project](https://giovannilucente.github.io/portfolio/dynamic_game_trajectory_planner/index.html) and the related paper:

## 2. Generative AI for Trajectory Prediction
This project is currently in progress.
This project focuses on training a model to predict vehicle trajectories. The model takes an input image representing the trajectory over the past second and generates an output image forecasting the trajectories for the next second within the traffic scenario.
For more details, visit the [project page](https://giovannilucente.github.io/portfolio/generative_ai_trajectory_prediction/index.html) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/giovannilucente/portfolio/tree/main/generative_ai_trajectory_prediction).
This project is conducted in collaboration with other colleagues from DLR.
