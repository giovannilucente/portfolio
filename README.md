### Portfolio
This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on over the years. For some of them I can share the codebase.

## 1. DeepGame-TP: Dynamic Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planner
The topic of this project is a trajectory planner based on a game-theoretical framework. Traffic is modeled as a non-cooperative dynamic game, in which agents choose their optimal strategies while considering that other agents are also optimizing their own strategies. The trajectory planner solves the dynamic game by computing the **Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)**, a state where no agent can improve its outcome unilaterally, given the strategic choices and constraints of all other agents.
