# DeepGame-TP: Dynamic Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planner
This folder contains a trajectory planner based on a game-theoretic approach. Traffic is modeled as a non-cooperative dynamic game, in which agents choose their optimal strategies while considering that other agents are also optimizing their own strategies. The trajectory planner solves the dynamic game by computing the **Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)**, a state where no agent can improve its outcome unilaterally, given the strategic choices and constraints of all other agents.

This folder contains the implementation of **DeepGame-TP** without the LSTM network presented in the paper. The application simply solves the dynamic game without using deep learning to predict the cost function. 
For further information and videos of **DeepGame-TP** implemented in [**ADORe**](https://github.com/eclipse-adore/adore), please visit this [page](https://giovannilucente.github.io/portfolio/dynamic_game_trajectory_planner/index.html).
